<h1>Productivity and <q>Contributed Value</q></h1>
<h2>Productivity</h2>
<p>In this section of the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter of his book <cite>The Practice of Management</cite> <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Drucker writes about how <dfn>Productivity Measurements </dfn> are the <b>yardstick</b> which is used to measure the <ins>effectiviness</ins> of a Management Team. <br/> He stresses that while <del>innovative</del> productivty methodologies may change over <s>centuries of</s> time, productivity Measurements and <i>benchmarks</i> must be adjusted over time to match them. Thus adaptation to change must be in one's <acronym title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</acronym>.

<h2><q>Contributed Value</q></h2>
<p>In this section, Professor Drucker defines <strong>Contributed Value</strong> as profit after the expenses of production, labor, and other costs of delivering a product or service to the consumer. Contributed Value provides us with Productivity Goals. An example of such a goal by the author is:<blockquote><q>To increase the ratio of Contributed Value to total revenue within an existing process. This is simply another way of saying that the first goal must be to find the best utilization of raw materials or of services brought.</q></blockquote>of A few insightful Business Leaders today would say that measuring Contributed Value is like measuring and drinking a bitter and necessary <em>H<sub>2</sub>O</em> to most Managers. The reason is that one sees potential profit ebbs away.</p>
