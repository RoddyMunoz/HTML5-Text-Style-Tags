<h1>Increasing Operational Scale To Grow Your Customer Base</h1>
<p>It is crucial to ensure that your facility size,staffing numbers / skill sets, inventory levels, and availible capital match your current customer demandfor your products of services. The reason is that if they are insufficient you will lose customers who will recognize you do not have the operational capacity to accomodate them. Your potential or former custoers will merely go to the competition who do have the scale to meet their needs. In 2015 we must recognize that reviews in social media platforms such as YELP can hurt your business if these same customers critique your Scale challenges.</p>
